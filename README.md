Odin Reecipe HTML webpage practice
This has been a hands on experience in learning html. Not gonna lie, there was a lot of youtube videos used to create the eng project which I'm happy with. I manage to put my own twist after learning how to take my HTML skills to the next level. I Rrefuesed to use CSS so that the project was done fully by html although there were many times I wanted to keep adding more unique components. For not having any type of experience coding, I'm happy I could acomplish this. I feel the need to clean up more my code so it isnt all around lmao. I'll keep learning as I go!
