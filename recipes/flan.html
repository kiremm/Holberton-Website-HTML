    <p><h3>History of Flan de Queso</h3></p>
    <p>Puerto Rican flan, known as "flan de queso," is a beloved dessert with a rich history that traces back to ancient Rome. Originally a savory custard dish, it evolved as it spread throughout Europe, becoming a sweet dessert during the Middle Ages. When Spanish colonizers brought the dish to Puerto Rico, local ingredients and flavors transformed it into a unique staple of Puerto Rican cuisine. Unlike traditional flan, Puerto Rican flan often incorporates cream cheese, lending it a creamy, tangy richness that sets it apart. Today, it's a centerpiece at family gatherings and celebrations across the island, with variations that include coconut, coffee, and fruit-infused flans, each adding a local twist to this classic dessert.</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredient List</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>6 large eggs        </li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened        </li>
        <li>â…“ cup 2% milk        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract        </li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).        </li>
        <li>Place sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until smooth.        </li>
        <li>Place sugar in an even layer in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the edges start to brown, about 1 minute; drag sugar into the center with a spatula once the edges start to brown. Continue cooking, stirring from time to time, until caramel is an even golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour 1 inch boiling water into a large oven-safe pot or baking dish to make a water bath.        </li>
        <li>Pour caramel into a 9-inch flan mold or baking pan; swirl so that caramel reaches 1 inch up the sides. Pour the condensed milk mixture on top. Set in the water bath.        </li>
        <li>Set the flan and water bath in the preheated oven; bake until a damp table knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Chill flan in the refrigerator until firm, 2 to 3 hours. Invert onto a serving plate so that caramel is on top.        </li>
    </ol>
